This is how I taught myself [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), using
[Plunker](http://plnkr.co/). The code is spaghetti; I do not consider it good
code, nor have I put effort into making it maintainable. However, on the chance
that it might be useful to some other Angular beginner, I've pushed it to
Github. After downloading, you should be able to open the HTML file and see it
work right in your browser with no special configuration.
