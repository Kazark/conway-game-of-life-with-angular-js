This is how I taught myself [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), using
[Plunker](http://plnkr.co/). The code is spaghetti; I do not consider it good
code, nor have I put effort into making it maintainable. However, on the chance
that it might be useful to some other Angular beginner, I've pushed it to
Github. You should be able to open the HTML file and see it work right in your
browser with no special configuration.
